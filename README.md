# Automated Email Sender

This application automates the email sending process to the specified receipents. It sends automated email with the required attachments to the receipents at a scheduled time and logs the status in a log file.

Instructions to run the application:

Unzip the file email_sender.zip and place the folder in a local drive

Navigate to the directory email_sender

Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Replace all the file paths in the code with your own path accordingly

Feel free to use the sender email id and password given in the code or create your own using the following steps:
     Manage your google account ----> Security ----> Turn on 2 step verification ----> App passwords ----> give a name to your app ----> generate password

     (Note: The original password used to login to your google account will not work with the code. Please use the password generated by following the steps mentioned above.)

Run the code and the automated email service should start at the scheduled time. To test, uncomment line 89 and the automated emails should be received in the receipent ids every 1 minute.

The log.txt file can be checked for real time updates.
